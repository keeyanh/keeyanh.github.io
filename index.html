      <p><b><u>Hello and Welcome to my Website! </b></u></p>

<p>This site was designed and created by me! I have a deep passion for programming and web design, and wanted to be able to practice the concepts I taught myself throughout my programming career. As I looked back through my academic career I found that I had a multitude of projects and experiences I wanted to write about and share with the world. Combining my programming expertise and desire to write and share about the amazing projects and experiences I have been involved I worked to create this website. </p>

<p>Please feel free to explore my site and read about all the projects, places, and experiences I have had the luxury of being a part of! </p>
