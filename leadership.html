    <h3> Position Definition: Search and Find New Recruits, Acclimate and Lead them through the process of joining our brotherhood, as well as keep the records of Sigma Pi </h3>
    
	  <h4> Goals and Achievements </h4> 
	  
   <p> At my time in the position of Herald I oversaw and managed the implementation of new recruits into the fraternity socially and financially. </p>

Due to my social abilities and outgoing friendly personalty my team (which received recruitment training by me) and I were able to recruit over 40+ new members into the fraternity since I had joined. Personally I believe our success was due to both the friendly personas but also by establishing a new recruitment algorithm I had been working on since I had joined. </p> 

However that wasnâ€™t my only goal I also worked to increased the retention of joining members by decreasing the joining price and establishing a new system to build brotherhood amongst new recruits and current brothers. </p>

I was also able to learn all the inner workings of the lore behind Sigma Pi , by also being the Ritual Chairman, due to this position my loyalty to the organization grew immensely and I wear our badge with honor and dignity. </p>

Finally I also upheld all of our records, with me at the helm, by decreasing the price of the annual composite I was also to save the fraternity $3000 which benefitted to our retention rates greatly. </p>
