      <p>For years I have been learning all about the things like theory and implementation, I found that projects, both personal and school assigned were the best way for me to not only practice my skills but also really work on developing a passion for the things that I was learning </p>
  <p>  </p>
	<p>I have always found that practice makes perfection and I have strived to practice as much  as I could in all aspects of my life to make sure that my skills were the best I could make them </p>
 <p>  </p>
	<p>As you peruse my projects you will find that I have done just that with my academics, both electrically and software wise  </p>
 <p>  </p>
	<p>I love getting better at things and I love learning and I will say that all the projects I have been a part of have helped me learn and better myself as a whole, and all the while really solidifying that this is what I wanted to do and taught me exactly what I love </p>
<p>  </p>
	<p>I have many projects uploaded on my website but also have more than a few in progress, if you are interested in finding out more please contact me! I love talking to people about current projects and discussing new and interesting ways to fix and solve problems! </p>

    <h2>Stock Market Investment League Simulator</h2>
    <h5>January 2019 - May 2019</h5>



   <img src="img_duck.png" alt="Keeyan Haghshenas" width="680" height="300" class="responsive"> 


 <h3> Goal: To Develop a fantasy game that allows aspiring investors to learn how to trade financial stocks.The game supports trading activities and simulates a broker who pretends to execute trading orders. </h3>

 <h4> Actions: </h4>




    
<p> As a group we were able to developed an interface that simulates role of broker that executes educated trades as well as simulates a competition aspect in order to make the simulator a game </p>

<p> We essentially created a fantasy league but instead of the statistics in a sporting game, we created a league with all types of functionality that uses actual stock data, including buy/sell stocks, trading, different game types, multiple leagues,   cross platform functionality, security features and real data as well as gearing the basis of the simulator to be educational in its function, teaching young investors how to operate in the market</p>

<p> Our software was designed to utilize SQL databases, big data analysis, .NET programming, Alexa Integration, and Microsoft's Azure to result in a website, and functional iOS and Android applications </p>



<p> However it doesn't stop there we were able to implemented desktop ticker hardware, using data from databases that shows how your stocks are doing in real time</p>

    <p>I also headed and organized all documentation and presentation of progression through development cycle,
utilizing symbolic representation of software life-cycle models</p>

       <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
    <h5>January 2019 - May 2019</h5>



   <img src="img_ht.jpg" alt="Keeyan Haghshenas" width="680" height="300" class="responsive"> 



 <h3> Goal: Create a Portfolio Website and Learn about HTML, CSS, and Java Script </h3>

 <h4> Actions: </h4>


    <p> I needed a place to store all my projects and for people to get to know me better and realize that I am much more than a resume </p>

    <p> I am a programmer at heart and a person above all, I love learning and educating myself on all languages and types of problem solving and my hopes in hosting this website was to spark more connection and conversation about different projects and methods of problem solving</p>

<p> I decided to teach myself javascript, html, and css, in order to program this entire website</p>
<p> Please feel free to look at the programming of this website and see how I did it, I am always open to suggestions! </p>

       <h2>Bank System Project</h2>
    <h5>January 2019 - May 2019</h5>



   <img src="img_c.png" alt="Keeyan Haghshenas" width="680" height="300" class="responsive"> 


 <h3> Goal: To Created a system that models a bank account using C++ features</h3>

 <h4> Actions: </h4>


    <p> I was able to draft 25+ different functions and 500+ lines of code across numerous files to use in tandem to implement a functional bank account simulator, focusing on C++ OOP features, including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
 </p>

    <p> Created and implemented different functions inside the system to transfer, check, withdraw and deposit money inside of the bank account</p>

<p> Used an object oriented design startegy to create the structure for the overall program, and once implemented I then worked to optimize the sorting algorithms that sifted through the data given to us to account for time and space complexity. 
</p>
	  
<p> This was my first introduction into object ortiened design and I was so greatful it was done inside my most familiar language C++ </p>

       <h2>Bank & Stock System Project</h2>
    <h5>January 2019 - May 2019</h5>



   <img src="img_c.png" alt="Keeyan Haghshenas" width="680" height="300" class="responsive"> 



 <h3> Goal: To Created a system that models a stock market account and can communicate with previous bank account project using C++ features</h3>

 <h4> Actions: </h4>


    <p> This was my second project focused around object oriented design also in C++ and I was able to draft 50+ different functions and 1000+ lines of code across numerous files to use in tandem to implement a functional stock market account simulator that communicated with a bank account, focusing on C++ OOP features, including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
 </p>

    <p> I was also able to create and implemented different functions inside the system to buy/sell stock, and display 
	    current portfolio, transaction history, and current price for stock model. </p>
	  


<p> Used an object oriented design startegy to create the structure for the overall program, then I drafted these functions with real stocks and had it operate in real time to ensure that the system was functional and efficient. 
</p>
	  
<p> Other than the obvious ability to practice OOP concepts I also took this project as an oppoturnity to displayed expertise in pointers, vectors, passing functions and recursion. </p>
