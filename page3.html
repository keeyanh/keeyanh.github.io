    <h2>About My Internships</h2>
<hr>
	<img src="img_headshot.png" alt="Keeyan Haghshenas" width="170" height="170">

 
      <p>Throughout my years in academia I have learned so much the minutia of all things electrical and software. It has been a wonderful journey and I am so grateful to have been given the ability to be introduced and learnt on all the incredibly interesting topics I was able to study. However being myself, the practice oriented, knowledge hungry, dedicated person I am, I was eager to enter the professional world and see how I could sharpen my skills in a professional sense. To really become the embodiment of professional in the world of engineering. </p>
  <p>  </p>
	<p>I am very grateful to have been given the opportunity to intern in both the electrical and software fields and I feel that it has made me a very well rounded person as a whole. Due to the nature of engineering, I had felt very comfortable in both fields and I accredit that to my ability to “think like an engineer”. Something that is often overlooked are the similarities between the two fields, despite the common misconception that they are completely separate there is a lot of crossover. Perhaps the technical similarities between the two fields are not as apparent as the clear differences however often the soft skills such great communication skills, or being able to operate in and also lead a team are parallels that I have seen and participated in.  </p>
 <p>  </p>
	<p>To elaborate further, I can think of a specific example of a skill that I picked up in my electrical engineering internship while  reviewing and designing electrical plans, and then see how it made me a better programmer. The revision portion of the design process not only requires a strong overall knowledge of the system you are designing and revising, but also a meticulous attention to detail to catch even the smallest of errors ranging from design problems to formatting errors. The practice I gained with this soft skill in the electrical field while reviewing every inch of hundreds of plans both designed and not designed by myself was something that I am not only eternally grateful for but also something that I saw an immediate benefit from. The immense amount of practice had transformed me into an entirely detailed oriented person, who can often be heard saying “the devil is in the details”.   </p>
 <p>  </p>
	<p>It was because of this that I immediately saw carry over of this skill into my programming field, as I became much better understanding over arching programs while also becoming an excellent debugger with the ability now to just look at complicated scripts and pick out the problem.  </p>
<p>  </p>
	<p>These are just some of the few parallels I have seen between the two fields, and it really solidified an ideology that I was developing about engineering as whole. Engineering is not the ability to be great at math, or solve complicated field specific problems. Engineering is way of thinking. It is a methodology to problem solving; being able to look at a system, fix problems and make things more efficient is what engineering is to me. Something I think that often gets lost in the classes, is this ideology. That when you are learning these complicated theories in the classroom, it is as much about the material as it is strengthening the ability to think like an engineer. To have the meticulous attention to detail and be able to problem solve complex systems.  </p>
<p>  </p>
	  <p>It is this ideology and the adage think like an engineer I will always carry throughout my life and I will always make the focus of my professional career.  </p>

    <h2>Aersys Inc.</h2>
	  <h3> Position: Software Developer Intern, May 2019 - July 2019 </h3>
    
   <img src="img_aersys.png" alt="Keeyan Haghshenas" width="680" height="300" class="responsive"> 

<p>Software Developer with a focus on Front End Development</p>
<p> </p>
	  


<p> Aersys Inc. is a startup company that focuses on developing the infrastructure for autonomous delivery. To quote their website, “Aersys Inc. is an early-stage tech startup that is developing a network of automated micro-fulfillment centers to enable commercial-scale automated delivery with drones, rovers and other vehicles.” They are a company of wonderful people and I am honored to have the opportunity to develop there.</p> 

<p> Job Description: Interns on a software track will work directly with our lead developers to build applications that add functionality to the Aersys delivery platform. Projects will cover topics such as Mobile and Web Application Development, Computer Vision, Internet of Things (IoT), and Industrial Robotics Applications. Software interns will become well-versed in several cutting-edge technologies. Strong experience with programming is necessary for this track and we will ask to see past projects.</p> 

<p> Tasks and Requirements:
I was a Software Developer Intern with a focus on front end development. Throughout my time at Aersys I worked to develop and eventually revamp their entire Android Application experience. Throughout my first week, I was tasked to develop the application from their already in place wireframes. Though once my programming expertise was recognized as well as my eye for UI/UX design, I then worked with the business and marketing team to completely revamp the Android Application. During my time at Aersys , I drafted new wireframes for the application collaborating closes with marketing, then implemented them inside Android Studio. Throughout my time, I was able to develop their entire application, first implementing security by creating a two factor login in feature that communicated with the existing databases. From there, to optimize time and space complexity I implemented a feature of Android development called fragments that allowed faster switching between different pages of the application. Further more I was tasked with implementing location finding and maps features (similar to Snapchat’s map functionality). Utilizing the google map’s API, I was able to implement all map functionality going as far as using dummy data for location of fulfillment centers, and having them display on the maps application and be interactive. Finally once my application was completely finished, I was looking for a challenge and asked the executives of Aersys to work with me to develop a marketplace functionality. Similar to Amazons, I studied and worked tirelessly to implement the functionality before the applications due date, to which I did. Implementing both framework and functionality! During my time there, after listening to the requests of the many developers I spoke with the backend development team in order to develop a company specific API to aid in development. Through our collaboration we were able to develop a company wide API that aided in the speed of the development cycle. Due to my expertise and work ethic I was made head of Android development, and because of my dual degree I was able to oversee and aid in the engineering development as well. In my time there I floated around from team to team helping where I could as well as working on my assigned work and completing it on time.</p> 

<p>From these additional responsibilities, I was eventually allowed to run biweekly meeting to coordinate and plan our company’s development Sprints. I worked with all teams and lead these meetings I make sure that all deadlines could be met and all expectation were reasonable and achievable. On top of this, the company employed an AGILE work style with frequent SCUM meetings, to which often I was the scrum master. </p>

<p> What I learned:
When I started developing the application I took it upon myself to learn the language android studio uses to develop the logic behind application, it is known as Kotlin.
Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.
As well as taking it upon myself to learn the ins and outs of XML, the language used to format the look of the application. With my hand the wireframe development I would have to say this was one of my favorite portions of the job. </p>
