    <h5>Photo of me:</h5>
	<img src="img_headshot.png" alt="Keeyan Haghshenas" width="170" height="170">

 
      <p>For years I have been learning all about the things like theory and implementation, I found that projects, both personal and school assigned were the best way for me to not only practice my skills but also really work on developing a passion for the things that I was learning </p>
  <p>  </p>
	<p>I have always found that practice makes perfection and I have strived to practice as much  as I could in all aspects of my life to make sure that my skills were the best I could make them </p>
 <p>  </p>
	<p>As you peruse my projects you will find that I have done just that with my academics, both electrically and software wise  </p>
 <p>  </p>
	<p>I love getting better at things and I love learning and I will say that all the projects I have been a part of have helped me learn and better myself as a whole, and all the while really solidifying that this is what I wanted to do and taught me exactly what I love </p>
<p>  </p>
	<p>I have many projects uploaded on my website but also have more than a few in progress, if you are interested in finding out more please contact me! I love talking to people about current projects and discussing new and interesting ways to fix and solve problems! </p>

 <h3> Goal: To Develop a fantasy game that allows aspiring investors to learn how to trade financial stocks.The game supports trading activities and simulates a broker who pretends to execute trading orders. </h3>

 <h4> Actions: </h4>




    
<p> As a group we were able to developed an interface that simulates role of broker that executes educated trades as well as simulates a competition aspect in order to make the simulator a game </p>

<p> We essentially created a fantasy league but instead of the statistics in a sporting game, we created a league with all types of functionality that uses actual stock data, including buy/sell stocks, trading, different game types, multiple leagues,   cross platform functionality, security features and real data as well as gearing the basis of the simulator to be educational in its function, teaching young investors how to operate in the market</p>

<p> Our software was designed to utilize SQL databases, big data analysis, .NET programming, Alexa Integration, and Microsoft's Azure to result in a website, and functional iOS and Android applications </p>



<p> However it doesn't stop there we were able to implemented desktop ticker hardware, using data from databases that shows how your stocks are doing in real time</p>

    <p>I also headed and organized all documentation and presentation of progression through development cycle,
utilizing symbolic representation of software life-cycle models</p>
