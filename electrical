      <p>For years I have been learning all about the things like theory and implementation, I found that projects, both personal and school assigned were the best way for me to not only practice my skills but also really work on developing a passion for the things that I was learning </p>
  <p>  </p>
	<p>I have always found that practice makes perfection and I have strived to practice as much  as I could in all aspects of my life to make sure that my skills were the best I could make them </p>
 <p>  </p>
	<p>As you peruse my projects you will find that I have done just that with my academics, both electrically and software wise  </p>
 <p>  </p>
	<p>I love getting better at things and I love learning and I will say that all the projects I have been a part of have helped me learn and better myself as a whole, and all the while really solidifying that this is what I wanted to do and taught me exactly what I love </p>
<p>  </p>
	<p>I have many projects uploaded on my website but also have more than a few in progress, if you are interested in finding out more please contact me! I love talking to people about current projects and discussing new and interesting ways to fix and solve problems! </p>

    <h2>Three Way Crossover Network</h2>
    <h5>March 2018 - April 2018</h5>



   <img src="img_duck.png" alt="Keeyan Haghshenas" width="680" height="300" class="responsive"> 


 <h3> Goal: To Develop a fantasy game that allows aspiring investors to learn how to trade financial stocks.The game supports trading activities and simulates a broker who pretends to execute trading orders. </h3>

 <h4> Actions: </h4>

<p>Designed three way crossover network for stereo speaker system, selecting specific capacitor and inductor values to produce best response for desired frequency range
Derived transfer function for high, low, and bandpass filters as a base for all remaining design
Utilizing both Matlab and Python, drafted Bode Plots for all three filters required in crossover network
Drafted and simulated design schematic using LTSPICE to produce, a magnitude and phase bode plot for the output of each filter, and the differential magnitude of voltage plot between all filters involved</p>

 <h3> Goal: Create a Portfolio Website and Learn about HTML, CSS, and Java Script </h3>

 <h4> Actions: </h4>

<p>Designed and simulated CMOS circuit to produce all possible values of any given boolean expression 
Designed reference inverter based on unique values of capacitive load, propagation delay and transistor sizing
Redesigned circuitry to produce MOSFET centered minimum area circuit design 
Simulated and analyzed transient response of output voltage for all designed circuits utilizing LTSPICE</p>

       <h2>Combination Lock - Digital Logic Design</h2>
    <h5>November 2017 â€“ December 2018</h5>



   <img src="img_c.png" alt="Keeyan Haghshenas" width="680" height="300" class="responsive"> 


 <h3> Goal: To Created a system that models a bank account using C++ features</h3>

 <h4> Actions: </h4>


   <p>Designed, simulated and implemented a combination lock that would unlock to a specific student ID entered in binary. 
Designed and implemented incorrect, correct, and entirely correct transition, and coordinated such with indicator LED </p>

       <h2>Bank & Stock System Project</h2>
    <h5>January 2019 - May 2019</h5>



   <img src="img_c.png" alt="Keeyan Haghshenas" width="680" height="300" class="responsive"> 



 <h3> Goal: To Created a system that models a stock market account and can communicate with previous bank account project using C++ features</h3>

 <h4> Actions: </h4>


    <p> This was my second project focused around object oriented design also in C++ and I was able to draft 50+ different functions and 1000+ lines of code across numerous files to use in tandem to implement a functional stock market account simulator that communicated with a bank account, focusing on C++ OOP features, including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
 </p>

    <p> I was also able to create and implemented different functions inside the system to buy/sell stock, and display 
	    current portfolio, transaction history, and current price for stock model. </p>
	  


<p> Used an object oriented design startegy to create the structure for the overall program, then I drafted these functions with real stocks and had it operate in real time to ensure that the system was functional and efficient. 
</p>
	  
<p> Other than the obvious ability to practice OOP concepts I also took this project as an oppoturnity to displayed expertise in pointers, vectors, passing functions and recursion. </p>
