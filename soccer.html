    <h2>About My Athletic Career</h2>

      <p>Throughout my years in academia I have learned so much the minutia of all things electrical and software. It has been a wonderful journey and I am so grateful to have been given the ability to be introduced and learnt on all the incredibly interesting topics I was able to study. However being myself, the practice oriented, knowledge hungry, dedicated person I am, I was eager to enter the professional world and see how I could sharpen my skills in a professional sense. To really become the embodiment of professional in the world of engineering. </p>
  <p>  </p>
	<p>I am very grateful to have been given the opportunity to intern in both the electrical and software fields and I feel that it has made me a very well rounded person as a whole. Due to the nature of engineering, I had felt very comfortable in both fields and I accredit that to my ability to “think like an engineer”. Something that is often overlooked are the similarities between the two fields, despite the common misconception that they are completely separate there is a lot of crossover. Perhaps the technical similarities between the two fields are not as apparent as the clear differences however often the soft skills such great communication skills, or being able to operate in and also lead a team are parallels that I have seen and participated in.  </p>
 <p>  </p>
	<p>To elaborate further, I can think of a specific example of a skill that I picked up in my electrical engineering internship while  reviewing and designing electrical plans, and then see how it made me a better programmer. The revision portion of the design process not only requires a strong overall knowledge of the system you are designing and revising, but also a meticulous attention to detail to catch even the smallest of errors ranging from design problems to formatting errors. The practice I gained with this soft skill in the electrical field while reviewing every inch of hundreds of plans both designed and not designed by myself was something that I am not only eternally grateful for but also something that I saw an immediate benefit from. The immense amount of practice had transformed me into an entirely detailed oriented person, who can often be heard saying “the devil is in the details”.   </p>
 <p>  </p>
	<p>It was because of this that I immediately saw carry over of this skill into my programming field, as I became much better understanding over arching programs while also becoming an excellent debugger with the ability now to just look at complicated scripts and pick out the problem.  </p>
<p>  </p>
	<p>These are just some of the few parallels I have seen between the two fields, and it really solidified an ideology that I was developing about engineering as whole. Engineering is not the ability to be great at math, or solve complicated field specific problems. Engineering is way of thinking. It is a methodology to problem solving; being able to look at a system, fix problems and make things more efficient is what engineering is to me. Something I think that often gets lost in the classes, is this ideology. That when you are learning these complicated theories in the classroom, it is as much about the material as it is strengthening the ability to think like an engineer. To have the meticulous attention to detail and be able to problem solve complex systems.  </p>
<p>  </p>
	  <p>It is this ideology and the adage think like an engineer I will always carry throughout my life and I will always make the focus of my professional career.  </p>
