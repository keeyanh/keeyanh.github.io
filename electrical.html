      <p>For years I have been learning all about the things like theory and implementation, I found that projects, both personal and school assigned were the best way for me to not only practice my skills but also really work on developing a passion for the things that I was learning </p>
  <p>  </p>
	<p>I have always found that practice makes perfection and I have strived to practice as much  as I could in all aspects of my life to make sure that my skills were the best I could make them </p>
 <p>  </p>
	<p>As you peruse my projects you will find that I have done just that with my academics, both electrically and software wise  </p>
 <p>  </p>
	<p>I love getting better at things and I love learning and I will say that all the projects I have been a part of have helped me learn and better myself as a whole, and all the while really solidifying that this is what I wanted to do and taught me exactly what I love </p>
<p>  </p>
	<p>I have many projects uploaded on my website but also have more than a few in progress, if you are interested in finding out more please contact me! I love talking to people about current projects and discussing new and interesting ways to fix and solve problems! </p>

    <h2>Three Way Crossover Network</h2>
    <h5>March 2018 - April 2018</h5>



   <img src="img_Unknown.png" alt="Keeyan Haghshenas" width="680" height="300" class="responsive"> 


 <h3> Goal: Design Three Way Crossover Network </h3>

 <h4> Actions: </h4>

<p>Designed three way crossover network for stereo speaker system, selecting specific capacitor and inductor values to produce best response for desired frequency range
Derived transfer function for high, low, and bandpass filters as a base for all remaining design
Utilizing both Matlab and Python, drafted Bode Plots for all three filters required in crossover network
Drafted and simulated design schematic using LTSPICE to produce, a magnitude and phase bode plot for the output of each filter, and the differential magnitude of voltage plot between all filters involved</p>
